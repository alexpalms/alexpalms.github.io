      Grade: 110/110 Cum Laude

      Master thesis in Space Flight Dynamics: applied perturbative mathematical techniques on Gaussâ€™ variational equations for both classical and equinoctial parameters. Obtained a semi analytical solution requiring only a few simple integrals that can be solved via numerical quadrature. Implemented the derived equations in a software simulator to be used for fast preliminary solution of multi-objective optimization in the context of complex, multi-phase, interplanetary orbital transfers.

      Work later published in Acta Astronautica, Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, and Advances in the Astronautical Sciences journals (see publications).

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
